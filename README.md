Second Hands on Session 
New York House Prices Classification and Regression Models
Project Overview
In this project, I have built both classification and regression models using the New York City House  dataset from Kaggle. 

Models Developed
Classification Models:
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting Classifier

Regression Models:
Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Ridge and Lasso Regression

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Ridge, Lasso Regression and Elastic Regressions

Each model was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared for regression.
